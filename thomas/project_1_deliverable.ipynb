    "Challenge: There exist way too many distinct chords. I know that the letter after the '/' is the bass for the chord, so if we remove that, the chord's sound doesn't really change that much. This changed the model from modeling the entire chord to only modeling the non-bass portion of the chord. Even after that, there were too many chords, so I made a replacement map that replaced the least frequent chords with chords that sound extremely similar or to equivalent chords with a more common name. That solved the problem and we then have few enough distinct states to make a robust model."
